# Etch-a-Sketch
An App, which simulates the popular drawing "game" Etch-a-Sketch!

# Description
This was an exercise following the "The Odin Project"-Path in becoming a web developer.

My hardest Project to date, but also the one I'm most proud of. It was about connecting many different techniques in HTML, CSS & mostly Javascript. Again, a very hard part was the DOM-Manipulation, especially getting a responsive Grid, where you can decide how many tiles the drawing board has.
I added some more functionality, like a color picker on the left side, and a little Notepad on the right side (honestly, the Notepad was just for symmetrical reasons, but maybe it is a cool feature for some).

Again, I learned a lot making this project. I'm getting pretty good in gathering the information I need for some of the techniques and I realized, that with each project, I remember more of the Syntaxes or method names or whatsoever..

# How-To
As soon as you hover with the mouse over the grid-field, you start drawing. On the left side, you can pick the color anytime, I also included an eraser. On the right Side is a little notepad, where you can write down ideas for your next piece of art. 

On the bottom, you do have a reset button. The reset button not only resets the grid-field (and the grid-field only), but after clicking it, you can choose your gridsize from 1-100 (e.g. input = 60; you get a 60x60 grid).

Have Fun!
